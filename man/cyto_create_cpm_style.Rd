\title{Create CPM style in Cytoscape}
\usage{
cyto_create_cpm_style(graph_input, k = 3, com_k = NULL, style_name = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_input}{the graph with the CPM communities}

\item{k}{clique size for the visualisation. This should be an integer with the value 3 or higher}

\item{com_k}{data_frame with the communities for the specific clique size (two columns: node and com_name). This is the result of clique_community_names_par() or clique_community_names()}

\item{style_name}{name of the output style in Cytoscape. If set to "auto", the style is derived from the name of the network and value for k}
}
\value{
The style applied in Cytoscape, no objects in R as return.
}
\description{
Function to create a style in Cytoscape to visualise the communities in a network using clique percolation method (CPM: Palla et al., 2005). See also: find_all_cpm_com()
Each node is filled with the colour of the community. If a node is part of several communities a pie chart is used to show the various community colours.
The function uses a graph as input and the number of cliques (default = 3). The style can be specified or automatically named based on the name of the network an the number of cliques.
Before starting this function, Cytoscape must be up and running!
